        * dds/DCPS/Serializer.cpp:

          Fixed a corner case in RTPS ParameterList parsing

          Without this fix, when the end of the stream is reached before
          PID_SENTINEL the parser may attempt to dereference an invalid
          pointer.

        commit cc3e9e666ec1bed7c1c57c1a9d73e147dc8e71ac

        * cmake/init.cmake:
        * docs/news.d/cmake-features.rst:

          "Un-cache" Feature Lists in CMake

          Fixes #4328

          The equivalent to many MPC features in CMake are built up using a
          function called `_opendds_feature` that adds features to lists to
          use.
          The issue is these lists are set as cache variables, which are
          persistent across CMake runs. This resulted in the features being
          appended each time, so they are listed multiple times in output
          and
          `default.features` if building ACE.

          These don't really have to be cache variables, so just set them
          as
          normal variables in the parent scope.

          Also fixed some typos in the same file and added a note about
          removing
          an include in the future.

          Fixes for Release Script and Doc Post-3.26.0

          - Fixed Read the Docs links in README not getting updated
          properly.
          - Fixed `gitrelease.pl --list` ignoring the current release
          workspace.
          This comes at the cost of having to have that workspace though.
          - Re-enabled Read the Docs version activation and updated release
          doc
          for this.
          - Other small fixes for the release doc.
